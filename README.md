# Project - Create your own predictive model

Predictive models are used across industries to analyze and make predictions about data. From sports to beauty products to app usage, predictive models provide individuals and businesses with data to make informed decisions.

Throughout this module, you have learned how to program both supervised and unsupervised learning models. In this final project, you will create your own! Throughout this project, you will work through activities to complete the following steps:

1. Choose a dataset.

2. Determine which algorithm is the best fit. Based on the dataset you choose, you will need to figure out which algorithm to use. This will require you to get to know your data and your goals! Is there a linear correlation between variables? Are you looking for numerical value or a label/category? Do you know the labels or do you need the model to create them for you?
- Do some tests with matplotlib and visualize your data.  Does it provide a good correlation?  Why or why not?

3. Program your model. Once you have chosen your type of model, itâ€™s time to create it! In this step, you will write a program that fits your chosen model to the data. Your program and output will be specific to the model you choose.  

4. Analyze and present your findings. An important part of creating predictive models is being able to communicate the results. In this final step of the project, you will present your findings using slides or an infographic. Your product should include the following components:
- Your reasoning for the algorithm you chose
- An explanation and analysis of the output of your model: What results did your model produce? What do they mean?
- A prediction based on your model
- A summary of the accuracy of your model
- Real world implications
  ***************************Write Up************************************
- We chose the multi variable model to see if there was any correlation between the land area and number of cows to the production of dairy products in India.
- Prediction: land area 83.28 acres; number of cows 18; actual liters/kilograms produced: 241; predicted value: 511.37
- The model showed that there was no correlation (-0.0) between total land area and the number of cows to the quantity of dairy produced in the region. This may be because of India's culture and the importance of cows in their heritage. Cows may just be protected and kept as pets rather than being used as dairy cows.
- Our main issue was that we were reshaping our data set when it was already in an 2d array.
- There was no real correlation between out data
- This data could reveal the quality of life for cows and consequently the health of the environment around these farms. For example, if the land area is very small but the concentration of cows and dairy production is very high this could be telling of some companies using CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) meaning that their cows are not free-range and that their quality of life is not as good as grazing cattle. CAFOs also affect the environment when runoff of feces causes algal blooms in near by bodys of water leading to a depletion of oxygen. A low density of cows and moderate dairy production may indicate that the cattle are treated fairly well.
